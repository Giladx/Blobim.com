After few years of research into DAW'S, since win 98 and WIN XP optimizations and complex installations true Windows 7, 8.1 , 10 (8 & Vista were not so usable) so called "modern systems" I have came to the conclusion that windows is not a real professional OS when it comes to performance and stability also it takes huge HDD amount and making simple things very complicated but .... Steinberg's VST/VSTi technology was coded in Windows  so I have turned to UNIX based systems, Back then RME cards were fully working with jack audio connection kit but many other cards where not supported and there was only few native Linux VST plugins and many LADSPA LV2 & DSSI self developments plugins and synths. so this is 2016 and thing just changed for good Windows VST can run on Linux & Mac OSX with wine.I know its not new but last dssi-vst, vst-bridge updates with the latest stable wine is working great.

So ... what I am planing to write here is about How to install the perfect Linux DAW based on Ubuntu-Studio 14.04 mixed with some more repository. how to install & configure the sound card (few cards models) and how to install &  run windows VST
